MEET MELOY AND HIS PUPS!:

Name: Cowboy Maloy

Origin: Right Cheere 

Occupation: Herdmaster

Likes: Coffee, home cookin’, a good day’s work, helping people, music, and his doggies.

Dislikes: Loud noises, cold weather, and anything he cannot repair.

Backstory: Cowboy Maloy had the luxury of being born and raised in the same house where he and his doggies call home. When he’s not training, grooming, and spending quality time with the pups, he’s known for helping his neighbors with the odd construction or repair job, always for free or a treat for the dogs.


The Dogs

Name: Bear

Type: Bernese Mountain Dog

Origin: Switzerland

Likes: Snuggles, carrots, blueberries, canned food, and boiled eggs. 

Dislikes: When the food bowl is empty, cheesy hats, and when the smoke detector is low on batteries.

Backstory: This gentle giant was a gift to Cowboy Maloy after he helped draft and construct a local church’s new daycare building. This dog also has an agreeable disposition and is a licensed therapy dog, known to make appearances at hospitals and schools to brighten people’s days.

###

Name: Rusty

Type: Border Collie

Origin: Anglo-Scottish Border

Likes: Playing fetch, long runs, popcorn, and playing Marco Polo.

Dislikes: The Delivery Van, doorbells, door knocks, and sleeping.

Backstory: Cowboy Maloy rescued this nervous Nellie from the local animal shelter after he saw this one clearly not having a good time in the pen. The collie’s natural herding instincts came alive instantly after adoption, and they’ve never been happier working like they always wanted. 

###

Name: Nugget

Type: Welsh Corgi

Origin: South West Wales

Likes: Ice from the fridge, whipped cream, belly rubs, and bum scritches.

Dislikes: Laser pointers, stairs, and reflective surfaces.

Backstory: Cowboy Maloy nursed this corgi back to health after it was rejected by its mother as a puppy. After lots of training and a careful youth period, they are now thriving in their new home with lots of other friends to be around. 

###

Name: Duke

Type: Old English Sheepdog

Origin: England (you knew that!)

Likes: Children, adults, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and you. 

Dislikes: Dirty paws, the hair dryer, and getting up too early.

Backstory: This sheepdog was an owner surrender, being one of Cowboy Maloy’s neighbors, due to the owner’s advanced age and rising costs to keep a healthy large dog in the house. They still pop by to see their beloved pet when they are able. Even though this dog is more accustomed to slow, clean, inside life, they are more than happy to be around others they like.

###

Name: Hazel

Type: Shetland Sheepdog, a.k.a. Sheltie

Origin: Scotland

Likes: Peanut butter, sleeping on the couch, and gettin’ a good brushing.

Dislikes: Fireworks, flashing lights, and green vegetables.

Backstory: It’s amazing that this sheltie was found as a stray, wandering around the streets and fields before Cowboy Maloy found them. After an exhaustive search for the owners, no vet microchip, and social media coverage, the sheltie is more than happy to call Cowboy Maloy’s homestead theirs.

GAME INFO:

A mysterious event called the Herdpocalypse has alerted multiple governing bodies across the country. Dozens upon dozens of formerly domesticated animals are being sprung from their pens by a mysterious figure. Eye witness reports corroborate a mysterious sheep that also looks like a pirate found near every outbreak. 

Famed rancher Cowboy Maloy has been asked by his local government to get his herding dogs to contain the Herdpocalypse and finally bring Woolbeard to justice. HERD UP!
